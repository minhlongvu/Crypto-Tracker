# Bitcoin Ticker ðŸ¤‘


A crypto currency price tracker app I coded using Flutter/Dart and based off starter code from [Angela Yu's (in collaboration with the Google Flutter team) Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/).
Be able to track the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash wherever you are! Many currencies are supported also!
